2. Query For Details

With the item above in hand, you can see the id of the movie is 343611. You can use that id to query the movie details method:

https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/343611?api_key={api_key}

This will return all of the main movie details as outlined in the movie details documentation.
 I would also suggest taking a read through the append to response document as it outlines
  how you can make multiple sub requests in one. For example, with videos:

https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/343611?api_key={api_key}&append_to_response=videos

Query syntax
Queries to the openFDA API are made up of parameters joined by an ampersand &. Each parameter is followed by an equals sign = and an argument.

Searches have a special syntax: search=field:term. Note that there is only one equals sign = and there is a colon : between the field to search, and the term to search for.

Here are a few syntax patterns that may help if youâ€™re new to this API.

search=field:term: Search within a specific field for a term.

search=field:term+AND+field:term: Search for records that match both terms.

search=field:term+field:term: Search for records that match either of two terms.

search=field:term&count=another_field: Search for matching records. Then within that set of records, count the number of times that the unique values of a field appear. Instead of looking at individual records, you can use the count parameter to count how often certain terms (like drug names 

e.g. https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt:"fatigue"&limit=1
