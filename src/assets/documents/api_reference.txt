2. Query For Details

With the item above in hand, you can see the id of the movie is 343611. You can use that id to query the movie details method:

https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/343611?api_key={api_key}

This will return all of the main movie details as outlined in the movie details documentation.
 I would also suggest taking a read through the append to response document as it outlines
  how you can make multiple sub requests in one. For example, with videos:

https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/343611?api_key={api_key}&append_to_response=videos
